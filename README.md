# Problem Solving Lounge
This repository contains:
1. My solutions to some different problems (I don't know why).
2. A template for frequently used **data structure** and **algorithms**.
3. A template for creating problems for **competitive programming** (Codeforces Polygon Style).

## Note:
Please refer to **[cp-library](https://github.com/CS80-Team/cp-library)** for more better and consistent **DSA** implementations/templates.
